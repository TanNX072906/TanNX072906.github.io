        Split Fiction is another masterpiece from developer Hazelight. The studio has crafted some of the best co-op
        games of recent memory, and following in the footsteps of the critically acclaimed It Takes Two, Split Fiction
        is a ripping yarn full of terrific levels, exciting gameplay, and likable leads.

        On Valentine’s Day, my best friend and I wanted to spend the day together, but since I live in America and she
        was in Switzerland, it wasn’t possible to organize something like a coffee date. Therefore we decided to try out
        a co-op game and settled on “It Takes Two,” an action-adventure platform video game that I have heard many
        people rave about, some even titling it the best co-op game to ever exist. And after finishing it over the
        course of a few weeks, I can confidently say that it definitely did not disappoint.</p>

      <p> “It Takes Two” follows the story of Cody and May, a married couple with their hearts set on divorce. However,
        after breaking the news to their daughter Rose, they are magically transformed into a pair of dolls. To reverse
        the enchantment, they must embark on an adventure through various parts of their house, but with a fantastical
        twist. Along the way, they encounter puzzles, boss fights, and an unexpected character named Dr. Hakim, a
        self-help relationship book who comes to life and serves as a marriage counselor for the stubborn couple.</p>

      <p> Players get to choose between May, a hard-working engineer and caring mother, or Cody, a stay-at-home dad with
        a passion for gardening. I chose May while my friend was Cody, but no matter who you play, this game will be an
        enjoyable experience. If you want to switch at any point throughout the game, you can do so by exiting to the
        main menu (a feature I wish we had discovered earlier so my poor friend did not have to suffer through the
        parkour).</p>

      <p>The game takes around 14 hours to finish with nine chapters in total. May and Cody start their adventure in the
        shed, before traveling to their backyard, Rose’s pillow fort, a play space station, a magic castle, a cuckoo
        clock, a snow globe, the garden, and then the attic. </p>
